      "Joy studio approached us in the hospital for the newborn photoshoot during the 3rd day of our stay & we opted for it with a basic package. The team was very well prepared for the shoot with the beautiful baby clothes. The team knows to handle the newborn during the shoot. After seeing the quality of the photos we went for a higher package. Further the editing by studio enhanced the photos quite well. Quality was really good.",
